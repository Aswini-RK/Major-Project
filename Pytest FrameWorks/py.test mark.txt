#The pytest file should have own pacakage
# the py test file name should always start test_ or end with _test
# Method (function) name should start with test_
# Each method are called as one test case
# method name should have sense
# -v for verbose,-s (standard output)for more info,-k for particular method name execution (required if we want to run the required name in the method which is present in two different file)
# Pytest marks are given below
# @pytest.mark.smoke -> for running for selected methods alone
# @pytest.mark.skip -> for skipping any method which give failed report
# @pytest.mark.xfail -> It wont give pass or fail report as output in command prompt
